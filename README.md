# Project Chat-Bot by Arnau Monforte Coronas and Amanda Elvkull

We have created a Chat bot with javascript. We have been handed the start code of HTML, CSS and Javascript from Technigo and then have we created the chatbot. 

## The problem
First we talked about what we want the chatbot would say to the user and then we created a script for the chatbot/user. 
When the flow of question was done we started to look at the start code and how to contiune with the task by create the code for each question. 
The technologies we have used for this project is: 
-Google 
-Stack overflow
-gimp 

For the hole project we have done mob coding with liveshare extension at visual studio code. 


Next step for this chatbot is to add soundeffect to the chat , for example; one sound for the bot and other for the user.
